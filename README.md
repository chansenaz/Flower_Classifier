Summary:
In this project, an image library (http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html), consisting of classified images of 102 flower species, is used to train a neural network via PyTorch. The resulting model can classify the species of new flower images.

Technologies used:
* PyTorch
* torchvision
* Jupyter Notebook
* matplotlib


The project is broken down into multiple steps:

* Load and preprocess the image dataset
* Train the image classifier on your dataset
* Use the trained classifier to predict image content

For more extensive documentation, see CH_ImageClassifierProject notebook

Image library should be extracted to a base folder named 'flowers'
